Maintainer: Joe Guinness <jsguinne@ncsu.edu>
Description: This package contains methods for fast computations
    for Gaussian process models. It is based on
    Aldo Vecchia's (1988) ordered composite likelihood method,
    but also has fast algorithms for reordering the observations,
    finding nearest neighbors, and grouping the likelihood
    calculations for faster and more accurate results.
